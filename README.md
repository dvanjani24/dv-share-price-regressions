# DV Share Price Predictor
This personal project explores using multivariate regressions to predict public stock share prices. The indepdenent variables covered include various macroeconomic and internal company-level financial metrics. 

As an avid investor and statistics geek, I enjoy exploring quantitative methods that can support my investment thesis. That said, I thoroughly appreciate that succesful investing is not as straightforward as crunching numbers, as qualitative factors like market sentiment, news flow, earnings surprises/disappointments, etc. can make or break an investment. An investment thesis should be a function of various factors, and each factor is just that, one factor.

The models are calibrated using quarterly data, as generally internal company-level metrics (e.g., earnings) are reported quarterly through earnings releases. Based on this, any inferences made on future stock performance should be aligned to the frequency of the historical data. Therefore, using regressions such as the ones explored in this project to predict day-to-day moves in stock prices would not make much sense. But for longer term investors, regressions against key macro/internal variables can certainly support the long-run trend of a stock's share price.
